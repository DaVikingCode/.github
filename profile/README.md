## Hi there üëã

Welcome to our GitHub organization page where we share our past and present open source or publicly licensed code, from research to production ready libraries and packages.

Once we worked on a game engine made with Adobe Flash / ActionScript 3, the [Citrus Engine](https://github.com/DaVikingCode/Citrus-Engine). It comes built-in with a "platformer" starter-kit, that was our beginning. We contributed a lot to the Flash community, even making open source ANEs (Adobe AIR Native Extensions enabling to call native code, Objective-C and Java, from AS3). While Flash was dying we moved to other technologies:
- [Unity](https://unity.com/), somehow the new Flash, that was also the opportunity to go deep with 3D.
- [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), a cool cross-platform toolkit, unfortunately too confidential.
- Canvas/WebGL with libraries like [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/), [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

We always wanted to use cross-platform technology, coming from a web background it's awesome to run almost everywhere! Focused only on games, serious games and interactive development at first, the team expanded and later we integrated traditional web development in our toolsets: PHP üêò [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), React.js / React Native, Node.js, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (the new Flex?). The dev ops part is not to be outdone, with all those fancies [Docker üê≥](https://www.docker.com/) (with also [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)), CI/CD things!

As technology enthusiasts we continue with XR world, and the initial gaming opportunities moved to digital twins and training. It's super awesome to entertain thousand people, the same applies to create custom tools for a few of them in needs! We continue our journey with all those technologies and adding a few more:
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), do we really need to introduce it?
- [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) Unity like editor but directly in the browser, ace!
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) we really need a web framework, isn't it?

Here you will find some open sources projects, have a nice journey! üåà
